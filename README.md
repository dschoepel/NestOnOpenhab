# Nest On Openhab - Step-By Step Guide

Google announced their [Device Access Program](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access) (September 2020) that allows users to access, control, and manage Google Nest devices using the Smart Device Management (SDM) API. SDM is replacement for the [Works With Nest](https://blog.google/products/google-nest/updates-works-with-nest/) program that was "retired" August 31, 2019 and no longer supported by Google as part of their acquisition of Nest.   

This guide is intended to document the steps needed to enable this this API so that it can be connected to the [NestDeviceAcces Binding](https://github.com/bhigg-code/openhab-addons/tree/dev/bundles/org.openhab.binding.nestdeviceaccess).
